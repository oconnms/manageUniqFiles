# manageUniqFiles

## The Problem
Over many years I've accumulated many photos.  As a consequence of moving them around different storage devices and creating albums for various reasons, I've created numerous identical copies of the photos.  I'd like to rationalise and remove the dupes!

I've looked around and there are a couple of tools which do this to varying degrees, but none of them were written by me; given I want to convert my Perl experience into becoming familiar with Python, this felt like a good project.

## manageUniqFiles

manageUniqFiles will scan a folder recursively, finding duplicate files which are then presented on the UI to enable the user to select which duplicate files should then be deleted.
